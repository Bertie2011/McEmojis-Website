# McEmojis

When Minecraft added the ability to add custom fonts, I created a resource pack (that added emoji pictures for certain character code points) and a piece of software that could open a pop-up with all available emojis (a window that could help you quickly insert characters into the Minecraft chat). It never really gained any traction and it was gathering dust in my private repo collection, so that's why I decided to make the repository public.

This repository contains the website that was made to promote and host the resource pack and software. Check out the actual [software repository](https://github.com/Bertie2011/McEmojis-Drawer) here.

The code is provided as-is, this repository is not maintained!

You can use, fork and modify the contents of this repository as you like, but please do not steal. Don't simply download all of this and host it somewhere.
